**TITLE;**  <br>
Call Centre Trends Analysis of Softclue Global Technologies

**PROJECT OVERVIEW:**  <br>
The "Call Centre Trends Analysis of Softclue Global Technologies" repository contains a comprehensive Call Centre Dashboard developed with Power BI, aimed at analyzing and visualizing call data to provide actionable insights and enhance call center performance. The project aimed to analyze sales data from multiple sources and present insights through intuitive visualizations and interactive dashboards.

**OBJECTIVE:**  <br>
Evaluate the Call Centre Analysis of Softclue Global Technologies in terms of key performance indicators (KPIs). Identify trends, patterns and anomalies in the company's total calls data over time. Generate actionable insights to inform data-driven decision-making. Enhance data transparency and accessibiity for stakeholders.

**DATA EXTRACTION:**  <br>
Collation of call logs and virtual case data from diverse sources to create a unified dataset. Consolidated call data from various sources, including call logs, customer databases, call center metrics and the company's SQL server.

**DATA CLEANSING:**  <br> 
Thorough data cleaning and enrichment processes for accurate and standardized data representation. Processed and cleaned call data to ensure accuracy and consistency for meaningful analysis. The column distribution, column profile and column quality was elucidated from the view ribbon of the power query editor. This was done to ascertain and check for the possibility of errors, null values, empty spaces, data uniqueness and distinctiveness, outliers, and inconsistencies.

**DATA TRANSFORMATION**  <br>
Transformation was done on the already cleansed data. The data had a lot of issues and required thorough cleansing, formatting, styling and re-organisation. This was done with a very high level of professionalism in order to maintain the integrity and originality of the data. The Transformed Data was then saved and made ready for the data modelling

**DATA MODELING:**  <br> 
Created an optimized data model to establish relationships between call logs, agent performance, and call types. Designed a robust data model, incorporating various tables, relationships, and calculated columns for analysis. Power BI's data modeling capabilities were used to create relationships between different datasets. Data hierachy and date table creation using DAX was done,enabling a holistic view of the organization's performance.

**VISUALIZATION AND ANALYSIS:**  <br> 
Interactive and visually appealing dashboards showcasing trends, correlations, and patterns for effective decision-making. Created interactive visualizations, including bar charts, line graphs, heatmaps, and geographical maps, to represent key performance, trends, and regional comparisons. These visuals allowed for easy interpretation of performance trends. The core focus of the project was on analyzing performance data over time. This involved creating time-based visualizations to track changes, seasonality, and growth in various KPIs. Key performance indicators (KPIs) were analyzed over time to access the company's overall performance in the regions where total calls were made.

**DASHBOARD CREATION:**  <br> 
Developed a user-friendly dashboard with slicers and filters enabling users to drill down into call details by date, agent, or call category. Constructed a user-friendly dashboard presenting KPIs, call centre trends, and performance metrics.
Filtering and Slicing: Implemented dynamic filtering and slicing options for users to drill down into specific data points. This dashboard was developed to present the insights in an intuitive and interactive manner thereby enabling users to gain a deep understanding of the company's performance.
